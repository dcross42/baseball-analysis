# Baseball Analysis

This repo will host scripts to download baseball data from various sources, clean it up, and analyze it.

It (currently) requires a local instance of PostgreSQL and Python3.

Thanks to the awesome people at pybaseball for their project. This project would not be possible without them.

**TODO**
* Add SQL scripts to clean up the data
* Add automation
* Add Data analysis/modeling/visualizations
